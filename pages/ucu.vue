    h1 Our UCU motion
    p On 5th February, we passed a motion to <b>work jointly across UCU and NUSU to campaign for financial and non-financial support for PGRs and to hold the university to account on the way it has treated its PGRs throughout the pandemic</b>.
    h2 Newcastle University UCU notes      
    ol
        li The ongoing impact the Covid-19 pandemic is having on postgraduate research students who conduct over half of all research hours in the UK.
        li That UKRI commissioned a report into the disruption that found 77% of PGR students required extensions for an average of 5.1 months.
        li That Newcastle University has acknowledged the disruption and has set up a Covid-19 Scholarship fund that offers a discretionary, 3 month funded extension.
        li Newcastle University has published guidance documents for the allocation of Phase Two UKRI funded extensions that explicitly excludes extensions for ‘time lost’.
        li A motion was unanimously passed at student council on 28th January 2021 calling on NUSU to campaign on behalf of PGRs for appropriate support and extensions. 
        li Many PGRs are active members of UCU including working as union reps and committee members and as such are important to the future of the union.  
    h2 The branch believes 
    ol
        li The new guidance published on 3rd February 2021 with regards to UKRI extensions is inadequate and does not accurately reflect the disruption to PGRs.
        li The current Newcastle University Covid-19 Scholarship Fund is insufficient given the scale of disruption and hardship.
        li There is a lack of clarity regarding eligibility and decision making rationale when applying to the Covid-19 Scholarship Fund with many PGRs being awarded less than they applied for.
        li Many PGRs are ineligible for a funded extension and are at risk of not completing their studies without urgent support. 
    h2 The branch resolves
    ol
        li To campaign jointly with NUSU on behalf of PGRs over the following: 
        ol(type='a')
            li To campaign for the University to offer appropriate financial and non-financial support to PGR students – initially in the form of three month blanket extensions, 
            li To widen the eligibility of the Covid-19 Scholarship fund allowing PGRs to apply earlier,
            li To campaign for the university to publicly back calls for improved funding from UKRI for PGR extensions,
            li To campaign for the supervision of PGRs to be prioritised in workload allocations of staff,
            li To ask members not to respond to Research Fish requests that relate to PGR outputs and impact that results from this (UKRI uses this to track research outputs and impact).
