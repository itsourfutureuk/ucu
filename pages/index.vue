            strong UCU-PG @ Newcastle University is a group for postgraduate students who are members of UCU.  Most members either currently work within the university, have previously worked within the university, or have interest in working within the university in the future alongside our studies.  
          p We are a self organised group formed entirely of PGR members from within the Newcastle branch. We campaign on a wide range of issues affecting postgraduate students including issues relating to their employment rights as well as issues relating to their student status.
          p We are currently campaigning to secure funded and unfunded extensions for PGRs, working within UCU and NUSU to lobby the university recognise the scale of the disruption caused to PGRs by the COVID-19 pandemic and offer support to ensure PGRs are able to complete their studies. You can read more about our work with each union below including the specific demands of the campaign.
