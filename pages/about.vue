    h1 About us
    p The PG-UCU Network is a group for postgraduates who either currently work within the university, have previously worked within the university, or have interest in working within  the university in the future.
    p PGRs who work often inhabit the position of being both students and staff, which comes with unique challenges and advantages. This group acknowledges the complexity of this position and exists to provide a voice and offer support for those who inhabit this dual role.
    p The network’s aims are as follows:
    ol 
        li To provide a space to discuss issues relating to PGRs who work, raising these issues with UCU or NUSU where appropriate and working to effect positive change.
        li To foster a community that offers support and solidarity to PGRs who work.
        li To provide support and guidance for PGRs who work in relation to broader issues surrounding their research and study.
    p Please note that if any PGRs have concerns which may extend beyond the remit of the network, we encourage you to approach us regardless as we may be able to help direct you to the appropriate place.
    p The network meets semi-regularly and has no permanent chair or secretary: instead, each member of the network takes turns at organising, chairing, and minuting each meeting.
    p Members are welcome to attend as many or as few meetings as they are able to. We also circulate communication via the email list, where people can share thoughts, ideas and queries – these can be discussed within the email chain and can be added to the next meeting agenda if required.
